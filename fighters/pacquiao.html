    <p>He moved to Mianila at the age of 14.  He began his time there living on the streets, taking up boxing as a means of good.  His first fights were for rice to feed his four other siblings</p>
    
    <p>He made the Philippine national ameateur boxing team, which covered his room and board.  He amassed a record of 60-4 as an amateur.</p>
    
    <p>He moved to the United States to start his career as a professional.  Comin under the training of former fighter Freddie Roach, he has since become the only fighter to win titles in eight different weight classes.</p>
