    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This page was created by Max Downs as a final project for a JavaScript class. </p>
    
    <p>Max is a huge boxing fan, having picked up a love for the sport from his Grandfather.  This page is a homage to what is considered one of the biggest boxing matches that was never made, most unfortunately.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you have enjoyed this page and the class.  It was incredibly informative!</p>
